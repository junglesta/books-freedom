scan it. shelve it. own your data.

## why

because your reading list shouldn't live on some corpo platform that sells your habits, goes down randomly, or gets acqui-hired into oblivion.

your books, your device, your rules.

## what

a dead-simple book library app. point your camera at a barcode, get the book info, done.

everything stays on your device in localStorage. nothing leaves the browser.

## how

- scan ISBN barcodes with your camera or type them in
- auto-fetches title, author, cover, and metadata
- organize with status (to read / reading / read), ratings, notes, tags
- search, filter, sort your whole library
- export anywhere: JSON, CSV, Goodreads, LibraryThing, Google Sheets
- works offline as a PWA — install it like a native app

## stack
