## WHY

because your reading list shouldn't live on some corpo platform that sells your habits, goes down randomly, or gets acqui-hired into oblivion.

your books, your list, your rules.

## HOW

- scan ISBN barcodes with your camera or type them in
- auto-fetches title, author, cover, and metadata
- organize with status (to read / reading / read), ratings, notes, tags
- search, filter, sort your whole library
- export anywhere: JSON, CSV, Goodreads, LibraryThing, Google Sheets
- works offline as a PWA — install it like a native app

## WHAT

a dead-simple book library app. point your camera at a barcode, get the book info, done.

everything stays on your device in localStorage. nothing leaves the browser.



## STACK

svelte 5 + vite + astro (workspace). pure static clients. local storage and ISBN lookup logic.

## MONOREPO

- `apps/webapp` → current Book's Freedom app
- `apps/astro-site` → Astro SSG site with `BOOK FREEDDOM CLIENT`
- `packages/library-core` → shared types + list/search/sort helpers

## RUN IT

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev:webapp
pnpm dev:astro
```

## HTTPS DEV (LOCAL + LAN PHONE)

Generate local certs (includes localhost + detected LAN IPv4 addresses):

```bash
pnpm certs:generate
```

Run webapp over HTTPS:

```bash
pnpm dev:webapp:https
```

Open:

- `https://localhost:5173`
- `https://<your-lan-ip>:5173` (phone on same Wi-Fi)

Note: phone browsers may still require trusting the local cert before camera APIs behave as secure context.

## ASTRO JSON INPUT

Canonical drop-in files:

- `data/library.json` (default dataset)
- `data/library.dummy.json` (optional demo dataset)

The workspace auto-syncs `data/library.json` to:

- `apps/astro-site/src/data/library.json`
- `apps/webapp/src/public/library.json`

Run manually:

```bash
pnpm data:sync
pnpm data:sync:dummy
pnpm data:apply ./my-export.json
```

Note: Astro SSG cannot write back to repo files from the browser at runtime.  
Use `data:apply` (or replace `data/library.json`) to persist edits into the drop-in folder.

Supported shape (`data/library.json`):

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "books": []
}
```
