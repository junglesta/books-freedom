# BAOBAB Changelog

Changelog for the `@bookbat/baobab` Astro display component. The sibling BOOK BAT webapp has its own changelog at the repo root (`/CHANGELOG.md`).

## 0.4.0 — 2026-05-20

**Breaking — license change.** Relicensed from **CC BY-SA 4.0** (copyleft, share-alike) to **MIT** (permissive, no copyleft). Footer link updated. Downstream consumers who depended on the share-alike terms must review.

- Expanded card detail panel redesigned as a 2-column grid (cover left, content right) with `<dl>`-based metadata, 65ch-capped synopsis, and right-aligned action row; collapses to single column on narrow viewports and when the cover is missing (via `:has(.bfc_detail_cover--failed)`)
- Wide-screen layout: 40/60 sticky sidebar — controls (search, sort, status tabs, language, view toggle, expand toggle) move into a sticky left column above 1100px, with the book list scrolling independently on the right
- Sidebar stacks every control on its own line; Search / Sort / Language each get label-on-its-own-line, input-on-the-next
- Header reset: BAOBAB title now `clamp(48px, 9vw, 120px)`, `font-weight: 100`, tight tracking
- Card summary: bumped author to `--fs-lg` and reordered the chip to `year · Read · ★★★★` (year first)
- Title color set to `hsla(0, 0%, 100%, 0.7)`
- Hardened cover loading: dropped `?default=false` from the Open Library URL so the SW no longer caches 404s as opaque entries; detect 1×1 placeholder via `naturalWidth`; added load/error handler to the detail-panel cover; bumped service-worker thumb cache to `v3` so old poisoned entries get evicted
- Raised idle-time cover prewarm cap from 120 → 500 covers
- `pnpm dev:baobab` now wipes `.astro`, `node_modules/.astro`, `node_modules/.vite`, and `dist` before starting (`pnpm clean` exposed for ad-hoc use)
- `astro dev` now opens the browser automatically (`--open`)
- Capped `.bfc` and `.preview-panel` to a centered max-width of 1600px / 1400px respectively

## 0.2.0 — 2026-05-20

- Renamed package from `@bookbat/astro-site` to `@bookbat/baobab` and moved directory from `apps/astro-site` to `apps/baobab`. Updated workspace scripts (`pnpm dev:baobab`, `pnpm build:baobab`), Netlify configs, and ignore scripts accordingly
- Added compact list view with toggleable card / list segmented control; list mode is now the default
- Added status filter tabs (All / To Read / Reading / Read) with live per-status counts
- Added Language filter (dropdown auto-populated from the dataset, with "(unspecified)" bucket)
- Extended sort options with Recent (by `dateAdded`) and Rating
- Added Expand all / Collapse all control above the list, with live state sync from individual card toggles
- Added per-book Share (Web Share API), Email (`mailto:` with subject = title), and Copy book info actions in each expanded card
- Added Synopsis rendering at the bottom of each expanded detail panel; long unbroken text now wraps correctly via `overflow-wrap: anywhere`
- Added cover thumbnail to the expanded detail panel in list mode so covers stay accessible when collapsed
- Hardened cover loading: removed `?default=false` from the Open Library URL (avoids 404s being cached as opaque entries in the service worker), detect 1×1 transparent placeholders via `naturalWidth`, and added load/error handlers to the detail-panel cover. Bumped thumb cache to `v3` so previously poisoned entries get evicted
- Raised idle-time cover prewarm cap to 500 entries for larger libraries
- Added `astro dev --open` so the dev server opens the browser automatically
- Layout polish: filter row puts status tabs + language + view toggle + expand toggle on a single line; status-tab count number is larger and lighter

## 0.1.1

- Polished footer copy and structure: clearer BAOBAB / BOOK BAT wording, improved line grouping, cleaner section flow
- Added version tags next to footer brand names and removed the redundant standalone version row
- Repositioned gray divider; moved BAOBAB-specific `data/library.json` usage guidance into the BAOBAB section
- Clarified footer attribution and links (`baobab.junglestar.org`, `junglestar.org`, repo, license)

## 0.1.0

- Initial Astro client scaffold with search / sort / book detail view
- Thumbnail service-worker caching for Open Library covers
- Configuration defaults in `src/config/bookbat-client.config.ts` (header/footer/export/load/unstyled toggles)
- Page-level preview controls to simulate component config from the frontend
- Export panel (JSON / CSV / Goodreads / LibraryThing) moved into its own standalone section below the grid
